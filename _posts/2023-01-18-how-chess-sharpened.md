description: Discover how chess helped me improve my memory significantly after two years of active playing
---

Do you remember the years? The years we mainly spent our time at home during the pandemic? I think we both do. Suddenly, with so much time in our hands, many people found themselves bored to eternity and I was certainly one of them. While Germany's universities shifted to solely online classes, it was hard to find a reason to get out of bed. Even with Marcus Aurelius personally whispering in my ear to get going, wouldn't have helped me in early 2021. 

After watching endless of Youtube videos, Youtube's algorithms recommended a video of Magnus Carlsen playing a random chess game. While I don't exactly remember the exact video, it was similar to this:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mBNmnZTOyb4?si=FwnIDBvn2D-dI8mC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>


The disadvantages of having a big ego become apparent when you delve into unexplored niches. "That makes sense", "Oh right, he threatens the knight", and "Why did Magnus not take the pawn?" are just some of the thoughts going through my head while watching the greatest chess player of all time playing a casual round of blitzâ€”a poetic example of the Dunning-Kruger effect. After acting like Magnus should hire me as his new chess coach, I downloaded the chess.com app, and played against one of the beginner bots. Lo' and behold, while I did know how the pieces ove and already played chess briefly in my childhood, I had zero clue about how to actually "play" chess. After drawing the bots and occasionally winning, I felt confident: I must be a natural talent! This would greatly change after I lost nearly all the games against real humans.

After getting sent back to reality, I knew I had to start studying chess in order to start beating people up like they did to me. As always in my life, I simply couldn't lose. From that moment on I was hooked, and little did I know that playing chess would immensely benefit my future.
